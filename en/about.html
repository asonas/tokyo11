<p>Tokyo RubyKaigi 11 is a conference for the discussion of software development techniques. Developers will give an introduction to interesting parts of the packages which they have developed. Participants will be able to share in this knowledge and experience its appeal, then contribute to the discussion on how to further push forward development techniques.</p>

<p>While the main focus will be on Ruby, any topic is acceptable as long it has some connection with Ruby. Topics in which code does not come up, such as education, practical application, and improvements in quality and development productivity are out of scope. However, discussion centered on software which targets these is in scope.</p>

<p>We aim to provide a venue which will rekindle your technical curiosity, and allow you to rediscover the challenge and interest of programming.</p>
