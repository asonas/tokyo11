Tokyo RubyKaigi 11 is selling tickets for its conference and after-party social event.

 * **All talks will be given in Japanese.**
 * Please note that those wishing to participate in the conference are kindly requested to refer to the anti-harassment policies of other conferences (for example, [the RubyKaigi Anti Harassment Policy 2016](http://rubykaigi.org/2016/code-of-conduct/)) in order to avoid trouble with other participants.
 * Please note that in order to reduce the cost of hosting this conference, we are unable to accept any ticket cancellations or refunds requested by the participants. In addition, we do not impose any restrictions on tickets being transferred between individuals.
 * Children aged 15 or under, accompanied by a parent or guardian, may participate in the conference for free. However, please note that the parent or guardian will be required to purchase a ticket.
 * At the time of purchasing a ticket, all participants are required to provide their name and organization. This information will only be used to issue participant name tags on the day of the conference, and will never be disclosed to any third party organization. In addition, if any organizations were to place restrictions on the use of a participant's name and organization, they may specify a nickname that is different from their real name or any other identifying name to be used instead.
 * We plan to provide live streaming of the event. We recommend accessing this live stream for those who are unable to attend due to transport constraints and the like.
 * On the 5th floor of the venue hall, in 5C and 5E, we plan to provide a large rest area (with live streaming) and a small rest area (which visitors may use for looking after their children). Please feel free to use these areas during the event.
 * When paying via Paypal, the payee will be set to either doorkeeper or Koichi Sasada (Executive Committee Chairman).
